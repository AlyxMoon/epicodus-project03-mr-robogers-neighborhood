## Description

This is my third independent project for the Epicodus bootcamp program. The goal is to make a small web application that takes a numeric input from the user and returns a range of numbers, with some substituted for specific strings.

Tests will be utilized to check behavior.

## Setting Up The Project
1. Download the files or clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project folder in your code editor of choice
3. No special tooling is required to preview the site when developing. You can either open the index.html file directly, or use any tool to start a develop server which serves the index.html for
   - for example, in VScode, open the command palette and search for `live server: open with live server`

Optionally, you can set up your project to make use of `eslint`, which is a tool that parses your files to help find errors and enforce code style. You can configure VScode to read the eslint rules and present this information to you, and even fix mistakes when you save! However, since that set up may change on the user, I leave it up to you to figure out how to configure VScode (or whichever code editor you use) to use eslint.

To set up `eslint` though, you need the following:
1. Install `node.js` on your computer
2. Install `npm` or `yarn` on your computer. The following instructions will assume you use `yarn`, and you'll have to look up how to do the commands in `npm` if you choose to use it instead.
3. After you have this repository on your computer, open a command line in the root of this repository.
4. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies, these can be found in the `package.json` file under `devDependencies`
5. You can now run `yarn run lint` to manually lint your code and see any errors/warnings (this uses the script as defined in `package.json`)
6. Optionally, if you have configured VScode to use linting, it will show you the rules directly in the file without having to do anything!

## Explanation of Code

The core functionality for the app (converting number to the requested string) can be found in the `js/lib` directory. I opted to break the function into two parts: 
- function one (`convertNumToRobogerSpeak`) converts a single number into the desired string
- function two (`talkToUsMrRoboger`) creates a list of strings by calling `convertNumToRobogerSpeak()`

I have little desire for manually testing functionality, for that leads to mistakes and heartache. So I created a class (`js/classes/TestManager`) to help automate it. What this does is provides a way of adding any amount of tests, and manages the output. It can display to both the console and webpage, and currently is configured to do both.  

The actual tests can be found in the `js/tests` directory. There are two helper functions which take a testManager class and then uses its `addTest` method to save each test. I set it up this way so there's the option of running tests on demand (as opposed to immediately when added), even though I'm really not making use of that possibility right now.  

The main script file `js/scripts.js` uses both of those helper functions to add all the tests, then runs the tests immediately.

In the UI, tests can be displayed by toggling the switch on the top right of the page ('Test Mode').

The rest of the code deals with the input and output. I wanted to add a typing effect, so I created a function which only displays a single character at a time to the user, on a small delay. I thought it would be neat to have a randomized delay for realism, but getting a random interval weighted to a lower value (so there wouldn't be agonizing slow pauses sometimes) is something I never implemented. So the delay interval doesn't effect much.

And lastly, I tried putting my extra effort towards adding "character" to the page. I am pretty strong on a technical level, but I lack design skills and am poor at adding all those little touches that make a page great. To that end, I made a robot on the page! I played with SVG's to add a simple robot design, and even animated it a bit by making use of the existing delay when updating text.

Due to the text delay, typing a large number could involve a long wait. So I made a way to stop the output. This makes the robot sad though (I added character!).

## Objectives
- JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- Tests are included for each behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
- Application implements a loop and works as expected.
- The user can use the application repeatedly and see new results.
- All previous objectives have been met.
- Required functionality is in place by the deadline.
- Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

- Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
- Project README that includes, bare minimum:
  - author name
  - program name
  - detailed setup instructions
  - description
  - copyright and license information

### Further Exploration Objectives
- Add images, styling, and custom animations.
- Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
- Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
- Add a second form field that takes a name as an input. Then update the output so that the program states "Won't you be my neighbor, {name}?" instead of "Won't you be my neighbor?"

## Tests

The tests have all been implemented in the code, they can be found in the `js/tests` directory. They will run in the javascript console when the page is loaded, if you want to see all of the test results live you should open the page and look there.
