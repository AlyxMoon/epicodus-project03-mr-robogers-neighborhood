# Epicodus | Independent Project 03 | Mr Roboger's Neighborhood

This is my third independent project for the Epicodus bootcamp program. The goal is to make a small web application that takes a numeric input from the user and returns a range of numbers, with some substituted for specific strings.

Tests will be utilized to check behavior.
